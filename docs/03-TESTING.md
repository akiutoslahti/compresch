# Testing

## Unit testing

## Performance testing
*// analysis of performance with common compression corpuses*

*// analysis of effects of dictionary size with LZW*

*// lots of graphs?!?*

### Common compression corpuses
[Canterbury corpus](performancetests/canterbury.md)  
[Large Canterbury corpus](performancetests/canterbury-large.md)  
[Silesia corpus](performancetests/silesia.md)

## Conclusions
*// what can be efficiently compressed?*
