# Week 3

## What have I done?
Lots of programming again and a little bit of research on how to improve LZW compression further.

## How I have progressed?
* CLI usage has been implemented properly with Apache Commons CLI library.
* My own data structures for minimum heap, dynamic array and hashtable have been implemented and Javas own data structures have been replaced with them.
* Encoded files now contain a short 3byte header to identify used compression method.
* All core functions are present.

## What did I learn?
Learned how to use third party library with my IDE and gradle.

## Any troubles?
Again had some problems on what was new. Getting commons cli to work was a little bit hassle with IntelliJ and gradle, but in the end I succeeded.

## Plans for next week?
* Implementation and testing documents need to be started.
* Refactoring for code and javadocs.
* Start writing performance tests.
* Some ideas on how to improve LZW compression further: couple of predefined dictionary sizes and utilization of variable length codewords.

## Hours
* 10h of programming
* 2h of research into LZW compression and Java CLI libraries.
