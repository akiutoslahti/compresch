### Main program
Main program can be used to encode and decode single files with Huffman coding or Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression.

### Huffman Coding
Huffman encoding takes a byte sequence of symbols as input and produces a bit sequence as output. Intent is that encoded bit sequence is shorter than original byte sequence.

#### Encoder / Decoder


### Lempel-Ziv-Welch
