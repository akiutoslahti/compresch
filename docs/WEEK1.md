# Week 1

## What have I done?
* Decided my project subject and wrote a specification for it.
* Started a project with IntelliJ and Gradle.
* Initialized GH repository and registered to labtool.
* Wrote classes w/ tests for bit-i/o, Huffman trie and Huffman codebook utilities.

## How I have progressed?
Project is on a flying start. Idea is clear in my head and I have done some research on the project subject. A little bit of code has been written w/ tests.

## What did I learn?
I learned some necessary stuff for making a project like this happen. I had first time encounters with gradle, markdown and Junit. Travis and codecov were easy with the help of good instructions.

## Any troubles?
Nothin major. Only minor ones with all the project tools (gradle etc). Checkstyle was really giving me a headache, but I managed to get everything to work in my project with some well executed googling.

## Plans for next week?
Lots of coding. Maybe I could think about the class design of my program and plot some kind of graphic design about it for reference.

## Hours
* 1,5h fiddling with project and repo
* 3h for specification and research
* 6h writing codes and tests
