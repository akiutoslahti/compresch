# Week 2

## What have I done?
* Wrote code for many new classes and tests for them.
* Refactored a bit of previously written code.
* Reformatted code to more my liking. (Code follows Google Java style guide for all parts except indentation. I find two space indents to look awfully unclear.)

## How I have progressed?
* Encoding and decoding with Huffman coding actually works! Tested with 4,3MB King James Bible from Project Gutenberg. Compressed size was 2,5MB and GNU diff returned no results in comparison between original and decompressed files.
* Started writing code for LZW.

## What did I learn?
I learned a bit more about how to use my IDE effectively. Also I learned that writing tests is not so straightforward. Test coverage is easy to achieve, but to get tests to actually be useful and have some quality in them is frustratingly challenging. Writing tests will probably get easier as this is actually my first time writing actual unit tests.

## Any troubles?
A bit of headache with learning to write good tests. I am not really sure whether they are good at the moment, but I hope they are actually testing right things comprehensively.

## Plans for next week?
Continue writing code and tests for LZW and maybe even start implementing my data structures.

## Hours
* 12h writing program code and tests.
